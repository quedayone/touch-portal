# touch-portal
Scrips and such for touch-portal

Best practice for getting Application path for switchOpenApp.sh
Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, drag the application into the terminal window.
This should output the full path of the application.
copy output and paste into the (Optional) Command line text box in Touch Portal.

And turns out the new version 2.1.000 fixes the issue of slow application switching, so this script is no longer needed eh!
